# EasyFit Android App
EasyFit is an Android application that produces workout routines according to the needs of the user. Workouts are made up of a list of exercises which are selected based on four stages of user input: fitness level, fitness goal, muscle groups and available equipment. Once the user specifies the inputs, a workout is produced. A workout includes the number of sets and repetitions for each exercise and links to further information such as performance guides.
